How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

For the CRUD module, writing a maintainable and readable program was easy. The structure of a CRUD program is already broken down for me. So I sectioned the code off into the 4 methods. Each was commented for clarity. This also makes changing the code easy as it is easy to access each part. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

It is important to get a good overview of the problem as you approach it. As a computer scientist, this means fully understanding the requests of the client. Getting clear and concise needs from the client will help guide the entire coding process. In this case of the Austin Animal Center, we were provided with very clearn instructions and an easy to use database. My approach did not differ that much from other courses, but I did have to take certain things into account as I was approaching this assignment using multiple frameworks. I think adding more data points and information will be good to do when creating databases for clients going forward. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists help everyday people and companies reach their goals quicker and more efficiently. In the case of a company like Grazioso Salvare, we were able to provide them with access to their database in a readable and adaptable format. This will allow them to edit their database on the fly and help them focus more time on helping more animals.
